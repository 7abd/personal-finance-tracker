# Personal Finance Tracker

This is a small personal finance tracker built with React. The goal was to create a simple way to add income and expenses and keep track of balance over time.

It uses React Context for managing global state and localStorage to keep the data even after refreshing the page. There's also a pie chart that gives a visual summary of where the money goes.

##  Why i built this 

I wanted to practice working with global state and also how to keep data persistent using localStorage. This project helped me understand how to structure components and how to think about data flow in a React app.
